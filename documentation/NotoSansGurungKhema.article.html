<h4>Gurung Khema</h4>
<p>
  Gurung Khema (sometimes called Khe Phri) is one of three scripts used for writing the Eastern and Western Gurung languages spoken in Nepal, Bhutan and India. These languages are often known collectively as “Gurung”, although they are not mutually intelligible. Usually, Gurung is written in the Devanagari script; however, in recent times, some Gurung-speaking groups have promoted the use of two other scripts, Gurung Khema and Khema Tamu Phri.
  Gurung Khema is an alphasyllabary. It is written with fifty-eight characters: one vowel, twenty-nine consonants, twelve vowel signs, six various signs, and a set of script-specific digits. Read more on
